# 1️⃣ How Applications Run Without Docker (Traditional Approach)

Before Docker, applications are deployed manually.

---

## Example: Running React App Traditionally

Steps required:

1. Install Node.js ( https://nodejs.org/en/download )
2. Install npm (installed along with nodejs)
3. Clone project code
4. Install dependencies
5. Build application
6. Start server

Commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

---

## Problems With Traditional Approach

* Node version mismatch
* Dependency conflicts
* OS differences
* Manual setup on every system
* Hard to reproduce same environment

---

### Common Problem:

> Works on developer laptop but fails on QA or Production.

---

# 2️⃣ Dockerized Approach (Modern Way)

Instead of installing software manually:

> We package application + dependencies + runtime into Docker image.

---

## Benefits:

✔ Same environment everywhere
✔ Easy deployment
✔ Portable
✔ Faster setup
✔ Production-ready packaging

---

# 3️⃣ What Is Dockerizing an Application?

### Definition:

> Dockerizing means creating a Docker image that contains application code, runtime environment and dependencies so that application can run inside a container.

---
## What is Dockerfile?

### Definition:

> **Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions to build a Docker image.**

---

### Dockerfile Is Used To:

✔ Define base image
✔ Install dependencies
✔ Copy application code
✔ Set startup command

---

### Example Concept:

Dockerfile is like a:

> **Recipe for building an image**

---

## What is Docker Image?

### Definition:

> **Docker Image is a read-only template created from Dockerfile that contains application code, runtime and dependencies.**

---

### Image Characteristics:

✔ Static
✔ Cannot execute by itself
✔ Used to create containers
✔ Stored locally or in registry

---

### Example Concept:

Docker Image is like:

> **Application package**

---

## What is Docker Container?

### Definition:

> **Docker Container is a running instance of a Docker image.**

---

### Container Characteristics:

✔ Actually runs application
✔ Uses CPU and RAM
✔ Can be started and stopped
✔ Created from image

---

### Example Concept:

Container is like:

> **Running application process**

---

# 2️⃣ Dockerfile vs Image vs Container (Difference)

| Feature    | Dockerfile       | Image                | Container           |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| What it is | Instruction file | Application template | Running application |
| State      | Text file        | Static               | Running             |
| Used for   | Build image      | Create container     | Execute app         |
| Editable   | Yes              | No                   | Runtime state       |
| Example    | Recipe           | Cake mix             | Baked cake          |



# 🧩 PART 1 — Dockerizing a React Frontend Application

---

# 5️⃣ Create React Application (If Not Available)

Run:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```

---

## Verify Application Runs Normally

```bash
npm start
```

Browser opens:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Explain:

> This is traditional way without Docker.

Stop app:

```
CTRL + C
```

---

# 6️⃣ Create Dockerfile for React Application

Inside project folder:

Create file:

```
Dockerfile
```

---

## React Dockerfile (Single Stage – Beginner Friendly)

```Dockerfile
FROM node:24-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/ \
    && npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit --no-fund
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

# 7️⃣ Explain Dockerfile Instructions

---

### FROM

Specifies base image.

```
FROM node:18-alpine
```

Means:

✔ Node runtime installed
✔ Lightweight Linux base

---

### WORKDIR

Sets working directory inside container.

```
WORKDIR /app
```

---

### COPY

Copies files from host to container.

```
COPY package*.json ./
COPY . .
```

---

### RUN

Executes commands during image build.

```
RUN npm install
```

---

### CMD

Runs application when container starts.

```
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

### EXPOSE

Informs which port app uses.

```
EXPOSE 3000
```

---

# 8️⃣ Build React Docker Image

Run:

```bash
docker build -t react-app .
```

---

## What Happens Internally?

* Docker reads Dockerfile
* Executes instructions
* Downloads dependencies
* Creates image

---

## Verify Image

```bash
docker images
```

You should see:

```
react-app
```

---

# 9️⃣ Run React Container

Run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 react-app
```

---

## Explain Port Mapping

```
Host Port 3000 → Container Port 3000
```

---

# 🔍 Access React App in Browser

Open:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

Explain:

> React app is now running inside Docker container.

---

# 1️⃣0️⃣ Verify Running Container

```bash
docker ps
```

Shows:

✔ Container ID
✔ Image name
✔ Port mapping
✔ Running status

---

# 🧩 PART 2 — Push React Image to Docker Hub

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ Login to Docker Hub

```bash
docker login
```

Enter:

✔ Username
✔ Password

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ Tag Image

Docker registry requires naming format:

```
username/image-name
```

Example:

```bash
docker tag react-app yourname/react-app
```

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ Push Image

```bash
docker push yourname/react-app
```

---

## Verify On Docker Hub Website

Login to:

👉 [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)

You will see:

✔ Repository created
✔ Image uploaded
